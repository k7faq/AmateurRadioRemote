General Development Path
------------------------

C/C++ will be primary for Hardware functionality controls. As each module has its specific needs the appropriate language will be used to allow incorporation of other Open Source Technology.

Establish communications protocols for Raspberry Pi devices to communicate wirelessly. Wifi with external antennas.
- Design necessary circuits, as applicable, to support external antenna(s) on each end.
- Software to support Serial Communications between Raspberry Pi and Arduino module(s).
- C++

Creation of controller interface - touchscreen and Android/IOS via BlueTooth.
- Java for Interface (J2EE)
- UI will call C++ apps for controls functions

Establish modules for popular radios supporting remote control.
- Will incorporate a variety of technologies.
- C++ will be the primary with heavy emphasis on API style functionality.

Addition of software for remote access via TCP/IP.
- Specific Language yet to be determined. Suspect C++.
- Will allow exchange of instructions between two Raspberry Pi units via TCP/IP.
o Security - Units must be paired.

Website 
- Yet to be established. As project progresses a domain will be secured and taken live.
- NodeJS 
o Allow users to lookup their personal registered devices and re-pair them remotely.
o Register Devices - CRUD
o Locate designs by other users for additional devices with build instructions.
