For decades Amateur Radio Operators (Ham's) have aided in Emergency Communications time and time again. As we all know our equipment is capable of communicating without the limits that many Emergency Services Facilities are now limited by.

While there are other remote control solutions for Amateur Radios available today this project is focused on helping Operators build their own without incurring costs of hundreds of dollars. Wether it be they want a remote hill top stataion or just don't want to drill holes in their home or like me who wants all the main gear kept in a seperate room with just the control heads at my desk. Whatever your reason this project is aimed to help you!

For those restricted by HOA's: Unfortunately too many of our operators are descriminated against (search FCC Rules and Reg's regarding antenna restrictions) and/or restricted by HOA's. This project will allow HOA domicile operators to utilize Remote Base(s) of their own or other operators. "Open" Remote Bases will be listed and available through the website.
